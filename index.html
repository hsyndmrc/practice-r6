        <h1>A beginners' guide to Rainbow Six Siege</h1>
        <p>
          Home to a dedicated community of millions, Ubisoft's acclaimed
          tactical shooter is one of the most finely honed online multiplayer
          environments on PS4 and PS5 consoles. If you’ve never played, your
          time is now – let us show you how.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Rainbow Six Siege?</h2>
        <p>
          At its heart, Rainbow Six Siege is a high-precision, tactical shooter
          that prioritises careful planning teamwork and finely tuned tactical
          play. Since its release in 2015, the game has radically expanded,
          adding extra maps, new operators, weapons, and themed seasonal events.
          The game has even undergone major technical overhauls, allowing for
          more diverse character designs.
        </p>

        <h2>Won't I be out of my depth?</h2>
        <p>
          Let’s be real, Siege has a high skill ceiling – top level play is
          tough – but for newcomers it’s no more demanding than any other game,
          so don’t sweat it. If you’ve played an FPS in the past decade, you’ll
          already have the basics down. Beyond that, you’ll learn by doing.
          Experiment with Operators, weapon loadouts, gadgets, and game modes to
          get a feel for your own style of play. Cut your teeth in the Newcomer
          playlist, go-up against others at your level, and see just how fast
          you outgrow it.
        </p>

        <h2>Modes</h2>

        <p>
          The game is split into two central pillars: PvE and PvP. Whichever you
          choose to start with, there are a few basics you’ll need to wrap your
          head around.
        </p>
        <p>
          PvE is split across two distinct modes: ‘Situations’, where you hone
          your skills in live-fire exercises, and ‘Terrorist Hunt’ where you
          team up with friends to neutralise AI-controlled targets and defuse
          high-threat situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          PvP is built on tactical 5-v-5 team play and is spread across a range
          of scenarios wherein Red and Blue Team go up against one another to
          defuse bombs, rescue hostages, or secure key locations.
        </p>

        <h2>Attack and defence</h2>
        <p>
          All playable Operators are divided into one of two categories:
          Attackers and Defenders - each has a role to play and you’ll need to
          understand both.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attackers, as the name suggests, are the siege force, charged with
          breaching, clearing, and securing the objective. Their gadgets are
          tuned to this effect, including a ready supply of ballistics,
          reconnaissance equipment, and crowd control weaponry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Defenders must withhold the objective, reinforcing the building’s
          entrances and fortifying key locations throughout the map. Again,
          their gadgets include armour and medic abilities to keep allies
          standing, and intel gathering & denial devices to block enemy
          reconnaissance.
        </p>

        <h2>Which Operator should I start with?</h2>

        <p>
          That depends on how you play. Do you prefer an armoured juggernaut or
          a spry tactician? Do you like to attack or defend? Start with these
          questions and work from there.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Operators have a balance between armour and agility – the more you
          have of one, the less you’ll have of the other. And every gadget is
          unique to the Operator: remote drones for scouting, resuscitation aids
          to revive your comrades, or a hulking sledgehammer to stove in doors…
          Experiment with gadgets, customize weapons, and find out what suits
          you; the roster is only getting bigger, so whatever your style there
          is an Operator to suit you.
